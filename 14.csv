ABBA,What About Livingstone,/a/abba/what+about+livingstone_20003055.html,"Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey, what's it good for anyway?  
So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then there's only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?

ABBA,When All Is Said And Done,/a/abba/when+all+is+said+done_20003009.html,"Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill  
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
Birds of passage, you and me  
We fly instinctively  
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor  
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run

And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

When I kissed the teacher

ABBA,Why Did It Have To Be Me?,/a/abba/why+did+it+have+to+be+me_20002575.html,"When you were lonely, you needed a man  
Someone to lean on, well I understand

Nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired, you throw them away  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I

And who do I want to be  
  
I went down to the river  
Trying to find peace in my mind  
In the throw  
I saw you glimmer  
The desire for you made me blind  
I first saw you at the distance  
When the moon's at its height  
I came to get to know you  
A disclosure so bright  
I knew, in my heart  
When your flair made me swoon  
I am just a prisoner  
In search of my tune  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
From where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be

Here I am at camp granada  
Camp is very entertaining  
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining  
  
I went hiking with joe spivy  
He developed poison ivy  
You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner  
  
All the counslers hate the waiters  
And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses  
  
I don't want this, should I scare ya  
But my bunk mate has malaria  
You remember jeffery hardy  
They're about to organize a searching party  
  
Take me home, o mudda fudda  
Take me home, I hate granada  
Don't leave me out in the forest  
Where I might get eaten by a bear  
  
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys  
O please don't make me stay  
I've been here one whole day  
  
Dearest fadda, darling mudda  
How's my precious little brudda  
Let me come home, if you miss me  
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me  
  
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing  
Guys are swimming, gals are sailing  
Playing base ball, gee that's bedda  
Mudda fudda kindly disregard this letter!

I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever tasted  
I think they fucking laced it  
Cause I'm so damn lambasted  
  
Oh my friend came over so I packed him a pipe  
I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype  
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it  
Two minutes later he was playing backgammon naked  
  
He's fucking wasted  
It's the best shit he ever tasted  
He's lost in fucking spaced-ed  
Cause he's so wicked wicked wasted  
  
Oh I spent the last two hours  
hiding under my bed  
Cause I looked in the garbage can  
and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
  
Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face  
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moonwalk all over the place  
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak  
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I've ever tasted  
My brain's been erased-ed  
Well fucking fried  
  
I'm sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat  
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet  
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe  
I said we ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you

It's the best shit I ever fucking tasted

So proud to be the one

Soon enough you'll be walking  
You and me hand in hand  
The silly words you'll be talkin'  
Only daddy can understand  
We'll go out making snowmen  
Building castles in the sand  
And all the time I'm thinking,  
Will this kid end up smokin' weed?  
  
But time keeps on going  
And you keep on growin'  
You're now six years old  
You're getting so good at your spellin'  
But my mind is always dwellin'  
On the fact that you  
Could be the kind of guy  
Who grows up and needs  
To smoke weed on the couch  
All the time  
All the time  
  
So answer me this while  
You're lying in your little bed  
Why must you insist on bein'  
Such a fuckin' pothead?  
There's other things in life  
That can make you feel good  
But you just keep on smokin' your herb  
You can't get enough of  
Your precious, precious reefer  
Where you getting all this money  
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?

Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.  
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk,  
And I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
I just need you now.  
Oh baby I need you now.

Adele,Now And Then,/a/adele/now+and+then_20746846.html,"Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
It cuts through the deepest parts of me  
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry  
How I'm still trying to stay inside  
Hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Every now and then my memories ache  
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
But as time goes on and my age gets older  
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'Cause heart break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal

Adele,Someone Like You,/a/adele/someone+like+you_20895042.html,"I heard, that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
I heard, that your dreams came true  
I guess she gave you things  
I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face  
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes

About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin' names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
'cause I'm sick of your complainin'  
About how many bills  
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just can't see no humor  
About your way of life

And I told him what I'd done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah, I hope you have some fun  
And a don't go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
'Cause you won't get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But there's one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine

There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more

From eatin' humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance won't last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass

The nights were dark and dank  
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....  
The buildings were dead and the alleys  
Stunk from things that used to live there  
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered  
  
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his  
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence  
With not a scrap left on the plate  
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable  
Cause the only thing left was their faith  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do  
About it....  
  
There's a Meltdown in the sky  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....  
  
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago?  
You could hear screams and moanin'  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of God's knife  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....  
  
There's a Melt Down in the Sky  
There's a new day comin and I don't know why  
There's a tear stuck in my eye  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died

You would run out of fools  
But I was so wrong  
You got one that you'll never lose  
The way you treat me is shame  
How could you hurt me so bad  
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had  
Kiss me once again  
Don't you never never say that we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
Never  
Never no no  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me  
  
I ain't never loved a girl  
I ain't never loved a girl  
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad  
What am I gonna do about it  
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to her  
I'm gonna hold on to her
